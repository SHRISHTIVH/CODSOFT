            <p>Kalpana Chawla is someone I deeply admire for many reasons. This page is dedicated to showcasing their admirable qualities and why she inspires me.</p>
            <p>Not only is Kalpana Chawla the first Indian woman to journey into space, but she is also an aeronautical engineer. She is a source of motivation. A ray of optimism for those ladies who dare to dream big and stand out from the crowd.

                She completed her studies in aeronautical engineering at Punjab Engineering College after being born in a tiny hamlet in Karnal, Haryana. She moved to the United States after getting married to her flight teacher and aviation author, where she finished her M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at University of Texas, Arlington, and her Ph.D. at University of Colorado, Boulder.
